# AUTOMATIC-RAILWAY-TRACK-CRACK-DETECTOR

The Indian Railway has one of the largest railway networks in the world, covering over 1,15,000 km. A recent study found that more than 25% of the track length needs replacement because of cracks. Detecting cracks manually is difficult and not very effective.

This project aims to solve the problem by developing an automatic railway track crack detection system. The system uses an infrared (IR) crack sensor along with GSM technology to send information about the crackâ€™s location to a central station. This allows maintenance staff to respond quickly.

The system is built with several components: GSM module, GPS receiver, Arduino board, GPS antenna, IR sensor, battery, and DC motor. The Arduino board is the main platform, and it is programmed to connect with both the GSM and GPS modules.

The GPS helps to find the exact location of the crack by providing latitude and longitude. The GSM module sends this information as a message to the nearest station or maintenance center.

This project is fully automated, meaning it does not need human effort to detect cracks. Automation reduces manual work, increases efficiency, improves accuracy, and saves time.

The main benefits of automation are:

Reduces manpower

Increases system efficiency

Decreases workload

Provides higher accuracy

Saves time

Reduces worker fatigue
